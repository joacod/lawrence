# Testing Patterns

## 1. Test Structure
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures
- Follow pytest naming conventions

## 2. Test Coverage
- Aim for critical parts of the code good coverage
- Test both success and error paths
- Mock external dependencies

## 3. Async Testing
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests
- Properly handle async fixtures
- Test async service methods
